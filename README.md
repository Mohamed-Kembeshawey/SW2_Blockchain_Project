# SW2_Blockchain_Project
This project is a demo for a blockchain system.
  *the initial values :
    -anyone enter the system will get 100 Bit coin to start with , then transactios begin.
  *we use peer to peer arc. to connect peers to each other within a server(file) that contain all localhosts and ports to 
   every one in the system.
features:
  -anyone can make transaction if he has enough coins to complete this transaction, i.e. the system search in all 
   transactions and calculate his coins and then deside if he can or not make this transaction.
  
  -if this peer was desconnected or want the previos transactions ,he will click a button (update Transactions) 
   and here we are, you got them.
  
  -the same for the blockchain , if you want to make sure you have the last update or the longest chain ease 
   all you have to do is to click on another button (Update blockchain) ^^.
